# First Application: Splitwise
**Link to application:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Splitwise.SplitwiseMobile&hl=en]

*Splitwise* is a finance related app which helps manage bills and spending between group of people. Users using the app can distribute expenditures among group of people with whom they want to share that expenditure and one does not have to worry about keeping an account of the bills manually. We need to add users to our account before we could share the bills with them and as soon as a bill is added, it sends out the notification to the complete group between whom the bill has been split. Also, users can settle the bill once they have paid back the due amount.
*Splitwise* offers another interesting feature called Simplify Debt which makes money lending/borrowing easier, by combining and then splitting the expenses accordingly.

**Why it was chosen**: Initially I always used to maintain the bills in my mobile in Google Keep and then had to share the bills with friends manually, however, using this app, I could simply add the bill and share it amongst the suitable group. Adding a bill sends out a notification to every individual involved in transaction. Moreover, other features such as custom percent of bill sharing, subgrouping within a group, receipt images support and easy debt calculation, make it a go-to solution for daily bills management.

**Technologies used**: This app supports both web and mobile platforms and can be broadly divided into: Front-end for UI, backend for server-side and a supporting database for storing user information.

**Type of Application**: Utility app (Genre: Finance)

**Strengths:**
1.	Easy to use UI with minimal number of views.
2.	Users have an option to create different groups which gives a flexibility to keep a separation between different groups/people.

**Weaknesses:**
1.	Simplify feature sometimes becomes a bit confusing for the users who are not used to this feature, as after simplification one cannot manually calculate anything anymore.
2.	People in a group that belong to same family, cannot be put together as one entity, leading to money being owed to members in the same family. Sub-grouping within a group is not possible.

One improvement that I could think of is, there is no option to pay the bills in installments. It would be good, if there was a flexibility for users to pay the bills in installments, notify when an installment is paid, and then finally settling up after last installment.

### First Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world
Notifications’ language used in response to different actions in this app is pretty straight forward and users can easily make out the usage of different features without the help of any help manuals, as the words and the phrases used are the ones being used in real world scenarios. Thus, it makes easy for the users to understand the interface and its associated features.
For instance, as shown in screenshot 3, it displays how the bill was split out, in a very basic and simple language, that is, who owes how much amount, and that the bill was split in what proportion. Thus, users can relate to the words easily.

### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
Splitwise provides exact information on errors and problems that occur while using the app. For instance, if a user is offline and tries to create a new group, he will be prompted with an error message that “Internet connection seems to be offline”. Also, if a user while inviting any friends, leaves the Email ID/Phone Number field as blank, it would display an error that “You did not enter a valid email ID or phone number. Please try again”.
Thus, it shows provided errors and the corrective actions in an accurate way.



# Second Application: Shazam
**Link to application:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android&hl=en]

*Shazam* is a song recognition application which has quite a large user base. Using this app, users can record any music playing around them and the app will detect the song for them instantly. It’s a cool app to identify the song you just heard around you, but do not exactly know which song it is, or you are curious about its lyrics or the singer/album. Once detected, all the songs get added to a list which can be referenced by users at any later time, to pull the detailed information of the song.

This app has been integrated with Google Play music and Spotify apps which could be used for playing the songs identified using *Shazam*.
It also provides quite a few sharing options on social media sites and also watching the song video on Youtube, which adds to the list of features this app has to offer. Now, this app has been acquired by Apple which could bring the power of this app to current and future Apple products.

**Why it was chosen**: When I first used this app, I personally found it quite interesting, as many times I heard music which I liked but could not add it to my playlist since I did not know the song. However, with this app, I can almost instantly find out the song playing around me and keep a record of it.

**Technologies used**: This app uses Artificial Intelligence(AI) concepts to match patterns of the songs it records and then tries to find the same pattern in its database of saved songs. The algorithm used is designed in a way such that it ignores the disturbances around the music while it is being recorded, in order to catch the song ID in the most accurate way possible.

**Type of Application**: Utility app

**Strengths:**
1.	An easy to use app with a user-friendly interface.
2.	Provides a minimal audio player with a play/pause option
3.	Ability to record the content when a user if offline, and displays the result when user goes back online.
4.	Other additional features like seeing lyrics of the app, related albums, singer.

**Weaknesses:**
1.	It only has a play/pause option and not a full-fledged music player. This would give an additional and important feature to the app if a full-fledged music player could be embedded in the app.

### First Heuristic Evaluation: Visibility of system status
*Shazam* notifies the users about the action being performed, for instance, while recording the audio content, it shows a neat graphic visualization and then once the song recognition is complete, it notifies the user with the song name.
Another example is if a user is offline, the app records the song and then notifies the user that the results would be shown once he/she is online, which is another good example of notifying users about the status of the action that they performed.

### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design
The app is super intuitive with one tap button on the UI that is the soul of the app. The user interface is straight forward and has minimal views which helps users navigate between different panes seamlessly. The different elements in the UI are also placed at appropriate positions, giving justice to the significant features as per their usage in the app.
Also, the amount of information provided in the app is apt for a novice user to use it without any major snags.
For instance, as shown in screenshot 1, the main feature of the app, that is to record and recognize the song, comes upfront when a user launches the app, and has a instinctive design which is easy to speculate.
